Input of data means to read information from a keyboard, a storage device like a hard drive, or a sensor.</br> The computer processes or changes the data by following the instructions in software programs. A computer program is a list of instructions the computer has to perform.<br> Programs usually perform mathematical calculations, modify data, or move it around. The data is then saved in a storage device, shown on a display, or sent to another computer. </br> Computers can be connected together to form a network such as the internet,</br> allowing the computers to communicate with each other.
